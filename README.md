## Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has many negative impacts on Indonesia and the rest of the world, so it is important to have a rigorous way to detect patients infected with COVID-19. X-Ray image of the patient's chest can help to detect whether the patient is infected with COVID-19 or not. We train Capsule Neural Network model to be able to classify an infected chest X-Ray with the COVID-19 virus. Models were trained with 6.310 Chest X-Ray images divided into three classes: Normal, Pneumonia, and Covid-19. The advantage of using CapsNet compared to traditional Convolutional Neural Network models : viewpoint invariance, less parameters, and good generalizations. We are able to train the model with results, validation accuracy of **0.9556** with test accuracy **0.9429**. The model could be used to provide additional information to help detect COVID-19 from the patient's chest X-Ray.
